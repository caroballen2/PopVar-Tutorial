# PopVar-Tutorial

Here, you can find a basic script to run PopVar R package (Mohammadi et al 2015) and examples of input files. 
Input files contain subsetted data from SunGrains (http://www.sungrains.lsu.edu/) propietary data, therefore names of marker and genotypes have been changed. 

PopVar_Code.Rmd
Contains a basic PopVar R script 

MarkersData.csv
Contains an example of SNP dataset for PopVar

PhenoFile.csv
Contains an example of phenotype dataset for PopVar

GeneticMap.csv
Contains an example of genetic map file for PopVar
